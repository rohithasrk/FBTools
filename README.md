#FBTools

>FBTools allows you to access Facebook via command-line.

##Highlight
It does not use Facebook Graph API.
So a lot of features like fetching full friend list are now available.
And its blazing fast.


##Current Features

* Check if someone unfriended you.
* Like all posts on a friend's timeline.
* Browse through your News Feed.
* Like any item in the feed.
* Comment on any item in the feed.
* Check your notifications.

###Upcoming Features

* Chat with Online Friends.
* User Timeline.

##Requirements

* Python3
* PhantomJS 2.0.0
* Python packages required:
  * selenium (pip install selenium)
  * pyfiglet (pip install pyfiglet)

##Issue

Posts not in English are skipped in the news feed due to decoding issues when writing the feed in command prompt (windows). Output on Python3 IDLE works fine though.
